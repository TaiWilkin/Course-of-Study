      This is a free, phonics-based course. Each lesson includes instruction in
      reading, spelling, and penmanship. Children learn to read in print
      (manuscript) and script (cursive), and to write in script.

        >Language: Grammar and Composition</a
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a free course in language. "Language" refers the study of grammar
      and composition. At this level, this is done orally in short lessons. It's
      recommended that you complete a mini-lesson (from Part I) at the beginning
      of the week, and then take advantage of naturally-arising opportunities
      throughout the week to reinforce the concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sample stories for models are given in Part II, to assist the teacher with
      the later work of the year. In Part III, short retellings of fables are
      given. Each week, read one fable to your student and ask them to then tell
      you the same story in their own words.

        >Arithmetic</a
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a free course in arithmetic. Expect this textbook to take two
      years to complete. Aim to complete lessons one through twenty-three this
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read the "Notes to the Teacher" carefully. For each lesson, plan to spend
      a week using manipulatives (pencils, coins, pebbles, etc.) to master the
      concept being taught in the lesson, before moving to the book for the
      second week. Create numerous additional problems of the same type and
      level as those given in the book until you are certain your student has
      mastered the skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is better to move slowly and thoroughly than to move quickly and
      without mastery.

    <h3>Geography and Science through Nature Study</h3>
    <p>
      This is a free course in home geography, science and nature study. This is
      a multi-year course; aim to complete one lesson per week.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Incomplete: </strong> This course is not yet available.</p>
    <h3>Literature, History and Civics</h3>
    <p>
      This is a free course in literature and history, focusing on reading and
      analyzing classic children's literature and poetry, with weekly readings
      about famous historical figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to provide quality content in large quantities for free, the
      books in this course are adapted from out-of-copyright vintage textbooks,
      which in their original format are severely lacking in diverse
      representation. To broaden the historical coverage, brand-new biographies
      have been written to cover a more diverse population.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I have been unable to source many examples of free children's
      literature which is written by diverse authors. A list of modern
      children's literature is included, and it is highly recommended that you
      supplement the provided lessons with read-alouds of as many of these as
      you are able to obtain. You should be able to find many of them in your
      local library.
